## Intro

Hi. My name is Dara and this is my GitHub repo for homewokrs done during **DevSchool 2023**. This a course organized by my faculty's Student Government where initiative and willing students act as mentors to 
> help their fellow students and teachers to gain a bit more knowledge and practical experience in a new field>
Also this is a great oportunity to meet new people, ecpecially for freshman students, but, in a time of online classes, crucial to all of us
## How to run a task

### Code editor

If you do have any code editor with node.js in it, you can just clone repository there and use
`node <filename>.js` in terminal of the folder to run task named _filename.js_ or just use _Run_ sign

### I don't want to open code editor

Well, then you can easily choose one or more files and do next steps:
**!Notice, that you still have to _have node.js installed_ and it's better be LTS at the time of November 2023**
* _Step 1:_ Save your javascript with . js extension.  Which is already done here, so you only have to download the file.
* _Step 2:_ Open the command prompt.
* _Step 3:_ Locate your path where the . js file is saved.
* _Step 4:_ To compile the .js file we have to write `Node <Filename>.js`
* _Step 5:_ Press the Enter key.

Congrats! You've managed to run taks's files. Here you go, have a nice cat image :smiley:
